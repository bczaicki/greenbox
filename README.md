# ðŸ“¦ GreenBox Technical Overview

## Introduction

GreenBox is the **central hub** of the GreenThumb AI system, designed to empower small-scale farmers and gardeners with precision agriculture tools. It connects seamlessly with **GreenLink** sensor nodes (based on Raspberry Pi Pico), gathering real-time soil and environmental data to drive smart farming decisions.

Built on **Raspberry Pi 4** hardware, GreenBox is **solar-ready**, **open-source**, and optimized for easy integration, automation, and future scaling.

## Hardware Architecture

### GreenBox Core
- **Device**: Raspberry Pi 4  
- **Power Options**: Standard AC or solar-based setup  
- **Connectivity**: Wi-Fi (primary), potential support for LoRa in future versions  
- **Expansion**: USB, GPIO headers available for hardware modifications

### GreenLink Sensor Nodes
- **Device**: Raspberry Pi Pico with sensors attached
- **Sensors Included**:
  - Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor
  - DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
  - ADS1115 ADC Module (for analog soil moisture readings)

---

## System Setup Overview

### Phase 1: Hardware Setup
- Connect DHT22 to Pi Zero W GPIO pins.
- Wire the ADS1115 ADC and attach soil moisture sensors.
- Ensure all power supplies and SD cards are properly installed.

### Phase 2: Software Installation
- Flash Raspberry Pi OS onto both Pi devices.
- Enable I2C communication using `raspi-config`.
- Install libraries:
  - `Adafruit_DHT` for DHT22 sensor
  - `adafruit-circuitpython-ads1x15` for ADS1115 module
- Write Python scripts to collect temperature, humidity, and soil moisture data.

### Phase 3: Communication Setup
Choose a communication method:
- **HTTP**: Use Flask to set up a basic web server on GreenBox.
- **MQTT**: Use Mosquitto broker for lightweight messaging.

Update the Pi Zero W (GreenLink) scripts to POST or PUBLISH sensor data to GreenBox, and configure GreenBox to receive and log/display data accordingly.

### Phase 4: Testing and Refinement
- Verify successful sensor reading transmission.
- Add error handling to sensor scripts.
- Optionally expand system to multiple GreenLinks or integrate cloud connections later.
